# Verilog Projects

## Overview

This repository contains **my work on Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language)** projects. Verilog is widely used in designing and simulating digital circuits, and this repository demonstrates various digital designs, including combinational and sequential circuits, written in Verilog.

### Key Topics:
- **Combinational Circuits**: Implementation of basic logic gates, multiplexers, decoders, adders, etc.
- **Sequential Circuits**: Flip-flops, counters, registers, and state machines.
- **Simulation**: Testbenches for verifying the functionality of the Verilog modules.
- **FPGA Integration**: Sample projects designed for FPGA deployment.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josethomas45/Varilog.git
   ```

2. **Install Verilog Simulation Tools**:
   - You can use simulators like **ModelSim**, **Icarus Verilog**, or **Vivado** for simulating and testing the Verilog modules.

3. **Simulate the Design**:
   To run simulations, navigate to the specific folder (e.g., `combinational_circuits`) and run:
   ```bash
   iverilog -o output_module module_name.v testbench_name.v
   vvp output_module
   ```

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Combinational Logic**:
   - Design and implementation of combinational circuits like adders, multiplexers, decoders, etc.

2. **Sequential Logic**:
   - Flip-flop circuits, counters, and state machines.
   - Examples include D flip-flop, JK flip-flop, and synchronous counters.

3. **Testbenches**:
   - Testbenches are provided for verifying each module, ensuring that the circuits perform as expected.

4. **FPGA Projects**:
   - Projects ready for FPGA deployment, including simple designs like LED blinking.

## Requirements

- **Verilog Simulator**: Any Verilog simulation tool like **ModelSim**, **Icarus Verilog**, or **Vivado**.
- **FPGA Board (Optional)**: For deploying FPGA-specific projects, a board like the Xilinx or Altera FPGA is recommended.
- **Basic Verilog knowledge**: Understanding of Verilog syntax and hardware design concepts.
